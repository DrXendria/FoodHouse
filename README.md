This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
First, install the required packages:

```bash
npm install
# or
npm i
```
Second, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

In this project, I used Next.js for front-end and back-end sides both. For making this project look great in front-end, also Tailwind CSS has been used. 
For back-end side, the authorization has been done with NextAuth.js. And the last remaining part, database is MongoDB. 

## Learn More

About the technologies I used, you can take a look at the following resources and documentations:

Last thing you need to take a look is [package.json](https://github.com/DrXendria/FoodHouse/blob/main/package.json) file of this repository. The libraries I used in this project are written here with their versions.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
